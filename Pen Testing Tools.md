# 1. Nmap

1.1 Sub-net scan, it's using the ICMP ping protocol to see whether it responds.


 

Nmap is checking the most common services to see if theyâ€™re open on the host. It does this by starting to open a connection to the service, and then closing it down before the connection is complete. This is called a TCP SYN ping, and it works by sending an empty TCP packet with the SYN flag set and waiting for the host to respond with the standard SYN-ACK response. While a normal connection would be completed by sending back an ACK, Namp instead cancels the connection before it complete.
